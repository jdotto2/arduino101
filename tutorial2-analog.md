# Analog Output (PWM)
Arduino provide analog output for some of its digital pin, analog output meaning it is generating a voltage value that is in between 0V and 5V. In actual, Arduino generates Puise-Width-Modulation (PWM) which is essentially turning the voltage on and off very quickly to simulate the analog voltage. Read [this](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM) article from Arduino to understand PWM more. The table below showing all the analog write avaliable pin on various Arduino boards.

| BOARD	| PWM PINS	| PWM FREQUENCY | 
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Uno, Nano, Mini | 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 | 490 Hz (pins 5 and 6: 980 Hz) |
| Mega | 2 - 13, 44 - 46 | 490 Hz (pins 4 and 13: 980 Hz) |
| Leonardo, Micro, YÃºn | 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 | 490 Hz (pins 3 and 11: 980 Hz) |
| Uno WiFi Rev.2 | 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 | 976 Hz |
| MKR boards * | 0 - 8, 10, A3 (18), A4 (19) | 732 Hz |
| MKR1000 WiFi * | 0 - 8, 10, 11, A3 (18), A4 (19) | 732 Hz |
| Zero * | 3 - 13, A0 (14), A1 (15) | 732 Hz |
| Due ** | 2-13 | 1000 Hz |
| 101  | 3, 5, 6, 9 | pins 3 and 9: 490 Hz, pins 5 and 6: 980 Hz |

For Arduino UNO, pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 are PWM-available, you can see they have tilde sign next to the pin numbers. 

# Fading in LED 
![](https://cdn.instructables.com/F60/IZJJ/I8ZQZMO9/F60IZJJI8ZQZMO9.LARGE.jpg?auto=webp&&frame=1&fit=bounds) 
To demonstrate the analog output features, we will reuse the same LED circuit from last execise but switching our pin to any of the PWM available pins.

```C
void setup(){
    pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
}

int i = 0;
void loop(){
    analogWrite(13, i++);
    delay(15);
    if (i >= 255) i=0;
}
```
In this example, I use pin 10. Note that the same writing of `pinMode` to let our microcontroller to configure pin 10 to be at output mode. On Arduino UNO, `analogWrite` slices the voltage into 256 levels, such that `analogWrite(10, 0)` would be full off and `analogWrite(10, 255)` will be full on. 

I used variable `i` to hold my analog level. The line `int i = 0;` is the declare and initializer of my variable `i` to be an `integer` type and has a value of `0`. `i++` increments the value by one for each pass and `if (i >= 255) i=0;` is a if-condition that reset my `i` to be zero once `i` is greater or equal to 255. 

In summary, I ask the microcontroller to increase the brightness of the LED slowly and reset it once it hit the full brightness. In a more verbose writing, see below:
```C
void setup(){
    pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
}

int i = 0;
void loop(){
    analogWrite(13, i);
    i = i + 1;
    delay(15);
    if (i >= 255){
        i=0;
    }    
}
```

# Fading In and Out
However, it is more satisfying is the brightness of the LED is fading in and out. Then `i` should be increasing and then decreasing symmetrically.
```C
void setup(){
    pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
}

int i = 0;
bool FADING_IN = true;
void loop(){
    analogWrite(13, i);
    delay(15);
    if (FADING_IN){
        i++;
        if ( i >= 255 ){
            FADING_IN = false;
    }else{
        i--;
        if ( i <= 0 ){
            FADING_IN = true;
    }
}
```
Here we add a new type of variable, `FADING_IN` is a `boolean` type which it can only hold `true` or `false`. In the begining, `FADING_IN` is true that the if statement will enter the first block which increment the value `i` one at a time. Once `i` is greater or equal to 255, it switches `FADING_IN` into `false`, such that in the next iteration, the if-statement will enter the second block, which decrement the value `i` and so on.
