# Analog
Arduino provide analog output for some of its digital pin, analog output meaning it is generating a voltage value that is in between 0V and 5V. In actual, Arduino generates Puise-Width-Modulation (PWM) which is essentially turning the voltage on and off very quickly to simulate the analog voltage. The table below showing all the analog write avaliable pin on various Arduino boards.

| BOARD	| PWM PINS	| PWM FREQUENCY | 
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Uno, Nano, Mini | 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 | 490 Hz (pins 5 and 6: 980 Hz) |
| Mega | 2 - 13, 44 - 46 | 490 Hz (pins 4 and 13: 980 Hz) |
| Leonardo, Micro, YÃºn | 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 | 490 Hz (pins 3 and 11: 980 Hz) |
| Uno WiFi Rev.2 | 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 | 976 Hz |
| MKR boards * | 0 - 8, 10, A3 (18), A4 (19) | 732 Hz |
| MKR1000 WiFi * | 0 - 8, 10, 11, A3 (18), A4 (19) | 732 Hz |
| Zero * | 3 - 13, A0 (14), A1 (15) | 732 Hz |
| Due ** | 2-13 | 1000 Hz |
| 101  | 3, 5, 6, 9 | pins 3 and 9: 490 Hz, pins 5 and 6: 980 Hz |

For Arduino UNO, pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 are PWM-available, you can see they have tilde sign next to the pin numbers. 

To demonstrate the analog output features, we will reuse the same LED circuit from last execise but switching our pin to any of the PWM available pins.

```C
void setup(){
    pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
}

int i = 0;
void loop(){
    analogWrite(13, i++);
    delay(15);
    if (i >= 255) i=0;
}
```
In this example, I choose to use pin 10. Note that the same writing of `pinMode` to let our microcontroller to configure pin 10 to be at output mode. On Arduino UNO, `analogWrite` slices the voltage into 256 levels, such that `analogWrite(10, 0)` would be full off and `analogWrite(10, 255)` will be full on. 

I used variable `i` to hold my analog level. The line `int i = 0;` is the declare and initializer of my variable `i` to be an `integer` type and has a value of `0`. `i++` increments the value by one for each pass and `if (i >= 255) i=0;` is a if-condition that reset my `i` to be zero once `i` is greater or equal to 255. 

In summary, I ask the microcontroller to increase the brightness of the LED slowly and turn it off once it hit the full brightness.
