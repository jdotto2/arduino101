## Arduino IDE

To start with Arduino, go to Arduino [download page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) to download and install the IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The software is where you program and flash codes into your hardware.

## Connect Your Device

To connect your device with the IDE, plug in the USB cable to your device and computer. After connecting the device, make sure to select the correct board, in this case Arduino UNO is used.
