# Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)

- The IMUs are navigational electronic devices comprising of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit)

## Applications

- Spacecrafts
- Airplanes
- Submarines
- Satellites
- UAVs
- Smartphones (e.g changing screen orientation by tilting the phone)

## Working Mechanism - ([https://www.arrow.com/](https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/articles/imu-principles-and-applications#:~:text=How%20Does%20an%20IMU%20Work,magnetic%20fields%20surrounding%20the%20device.&text=IMUs%20combine%20input%20from%20several,order%20to%20accurately%20output%20movement.))

IMUs can measure a variety of factors, including speed, direction, acceleration, specific force, angular rate, and (in the presence of a magnetometer), magnetic fields surrounding the device.

### Each tool in an IMU is used to capture different data types:

- #### Accelerometer: 
	- measures velocity and acceleration

- #### Gyroscope: 
	- measures rotation and rotational rate

- #### Magnetometer: 
	- establishes cardinal direction (directional heading)

IMUs combine input from several different sensor types in order to accurately output movement.
